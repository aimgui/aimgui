    04-rms-tracing.py - Auto-wah effect.

    The auto-wah effect (also know as "envelope following filter") is like a
    wah-wah effect, but instead of being controlled by a pedal, it is the RMS
    amplitude of the input sound which control it. The envelope follower (RMS)
    is rescaled and used to change the frequency of a bandpass filter applied
    to the source.
