    01-read-from-disk.py - Soundfile playback from disk.

    SfPlayer and friends read samples from a file on disk with control
    over playback speed and looping mode.

    Player family:
        - **SfPlayer** : Reads many soundfile formats from disk.
        - **SfMarkerLooper** : AIFF with markers soundfile looper.
        - **SfMarkerShuffler** : AIFF with markers soundfile shuffler.

    Reading sound file from disk can save a lot of RAM, especially if
    the soundfile is big, but it is more CPU expensive than loading
    the sound file in memory in a first pass.
