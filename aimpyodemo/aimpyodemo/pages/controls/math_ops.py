    05-math-ops.py - Audio objects and arithmetic expresssions.

    This script shows how a PyoObject reacts when used inside an
    arithmetic expression.

    Multiplication, addition, division and substraction can be applied
    between pyo objects or between pyo objects and numbers. Doing so
    returns a Dummy object that outputs the result of the operation.

    A Dummy object is only a place holder to keep track of arithmetic
    operations on audio objects.

    PyoObject can also be used in expression with the exponent (**),
    modulo (%) and unary negative (-) operators.
