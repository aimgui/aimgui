    04-noise-generators.py - Different pseudo-random noise generators.

    There are three noise generators (beside random generators that
    will be covered later) in the library. These are the classic
    white noise, pink noise and brown noise.

    Noise:
    White noise generator, flat spectrum.

    PinkNoise:
    Pink noise generator, 3dB rolloff per octave.

    BrownNoise:
    Brown noise generator, 6dB rolloff per octave.

    Use the "voice" slider of the window "Input interpolator" to
    interpolate between the three sources.
