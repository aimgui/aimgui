    """
    05-breakpoints-functions.py - Multi-segments envelopes.

    Linseg and Expseg objects draw a series of line segments between 
    specified break-points, either linear or exponential.

    These objects wait for play() call to start reading the envelope.

    They have methods to set loop mode, call pause/play without reset,
    and replace the breakpoints.

    One can use the graph() method to open a graphical display of the current 
    envelope, edit it, and copy the points (in the list format) to the 
    clipboard (Menu "File" of the graph display => "Copy all Points ..."). 
    This makes it easier to explore and paste the result into the python 
    script when happy with the envelope!
